##  Why I Made This

I created PaybackPro to combine my interest in **finance** and **technology**. It helped me explore real-world concepts like interest growth while practicing Python and data visualization. This project reflects my passion for **fintech** and using code to solve practical problems. I also think its quite cool to make graphs just from python!
